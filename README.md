How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

-Interpreting user needs invlolves understanding the customer's needs, and how to apply these needs to into a prorgam. User stories are made for this exact reason, as they serve as an efficient way to gather feedback and understand what improvements are needed in the program. It allows a much better structure for the developing team to know what to create or improve off of. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

- My approach to developing programs follows the principles of the agile-approach process. I clean, test and write code as needed, as well as reprioritize each process as needed. Doing this allows me to be more flexible and adaptable with my work, leading to a faster work flow and better production. Agile processes that I hope to incorporate in my work include good collaboration and communication with my peers and the ability to adapt to any changes or bottlenecks in the program productions.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

-To be a good team member means being a good collabarator, communicator, and problem solver. All good team members know how to effectively collaborate with their co-workers and work together to better understand and solve problems. They also know how to communicate with one another to express these problems and vocally offer solutions. Lastly, a good team member knows how to be a good problem-solver and work hard to come up with a solution to the problem.
